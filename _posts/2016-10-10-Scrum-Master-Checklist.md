title: Scrum Master Checklist
---

In this modern world of information explosion where the processes and procedures are complex and prolonged, people tend to make mistakes either due to ignorance or else due to ineptitude, the latter being the most common reason between the two. Now, how can this be solved? By using guides or checklists. Atul Gwanade, a New York magazine writer and also a surgeon by profession has a best seller on this interesting topic called ‘The checklist manifesto’. See it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000/) on Amazon.

As far as scrum masters are concerned, I stumpled upon two interesting checklists on the web, as shown below.


* [Agile Scout’s Scrum Master Daily Checklist](http://agilescout.com/scrummaster-daily-check-list/)
* [Michael James’ Example Scrum Master Checklist](http://scrummasterchecklist.org/).
