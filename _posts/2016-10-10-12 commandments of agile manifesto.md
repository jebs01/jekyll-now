The Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles:

1.Always satisfy the customer with early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.Changing requirements are welcome, even in late development.
3.Deliver working software frequently possibly in weeks rather than in months.
4.Business people and developers must work closely on a daily basis.
5.Projects should be trusted with motivated individuals and provide all the support they need to succeed.
6.Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location is important).
7.Working software is the principal measure of progress.
8.Sustainable development should be maintained at a constant pace.
9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design is needed.
10.Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11.Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12.The team should regularly reflect on how to become more effective, and then adjust accordingly.
