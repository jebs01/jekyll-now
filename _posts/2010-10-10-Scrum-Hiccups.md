In theory, scrum would help any team to deliver high quality products in shorter time periods. However, in practice some project attributes might affect scrum’s agility and product release. In such cases, use and purpose of scrum should be carefully scrutinized for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.

Lets have a look at such scrum limitations,

* Geographical co-location of scrum team is very important, because that could affect team communication and delivery.
*  Development team should not be highly specialized specialists, but broadly skilled generalists, so that dependency is limited and delivery is not affected.
*  Projects with heaps of external dependencies may affect sprint planning.
*  Long running projects often need lots of regression testing to ensure nothing is broken over the time and this mandates more time for testing before proceeding further.
*  Mission critical projects need highest quality testing and this again could affect scrum’s agility.
